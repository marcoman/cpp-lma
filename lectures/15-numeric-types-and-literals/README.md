# Introduction

This is a standard module going over data types.  Some things are new to me.

- The definition of fixed types is something I was used to seeing as dependent on the local architecture, so we went through some logic to define local types to specify our 8-bit, etc. sizes.
- The digits separator in the form of `1'000'000` is new to me.  _Interesting_
